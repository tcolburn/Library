RUnning scripts
----------------

Scripts are stored in bin/. (Python modules can live in lib/python)

To run scripts in a shell session:

  . ~/Projects/Beckstein/Mhp1/Library/setup_PATH

and then everything in bin/ is available.

Add to your .bashrc

  alias setup_Mhp1=". ~/Projects/Beckstein/Mhp1/Library/setup_PATH"

and then in a shell session

  setup_Mhp1

and you 're set.
